# Start Mining

First, you need a wallet address. This wallet address can be stored on the mining machine or elsewhere. The miner program doesn't require verification of the private key, so you only need to provide the wallet address. Your private key can be stored on another device for added security.

How to obtain a wallet address, and how to start, stop, pause, and resume mining, has been described in [Quick Start](quickstart.md).

The miner program is responsible for _PoW_ mining. After mining a block, it sends the newly mined block to the main program. The main program then verifies the new block.

If verification passes, the new block will be written to the blockchain (database) and broadcast to other connected P2P nodes. Simultaneously, up to 511 transactions from the transaction pool will be packaged into the next updated pre-block. After the pre-block is reached, these 511 transactions will be removed from the transaction pool. The reward recipient for the coinbase transaction in the pre-block will be set to the wallet address of the miner sent by _dsysbminer_ and inserted before other transactions as the first transaction, bringing the total to a maximum of 512 transactions. Then, _dsysb_ will send the pre-block to _dsysbminer_. Upon receiving it, _dsysbminer_ will use the new pre-block for mining, and after mining, it will send the mined block back to _dsysb_, and this process will continue in a loop.

If verification fails, the transaction will not be written to the chain or broadcast. Instead, the transactions in the current transaction pool will be packaged into a new preparatory block and sent to _dsysbminer_. After receiving the block, _dsysbminer_ will mine the new preparatory block and send the mined transaction back to _dsysb_, and so on.
