# coinbase

A _coinbase_ transaction is generated when a miner successfully mines a coin. It includes the mining reward, the total transaction fees from other transactions in that block, and the lifespan price of each asset and task. The sum of these is the _coinbase_ amount.

## Fields
- _to_: Miner address that received the reward.
- _amount_: Total reward amount.
- _nonce_: The height of the previous block to prevent _HASH_ data duplication.
