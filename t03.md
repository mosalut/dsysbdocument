# Multi-miner Mining

To make full use of the system's threads, multiple _dsysbminer_ instances can be started to connect to the same _dsysb_ instance.

The default HTTP port for _dsysbminer_ is 8569.

```bash
$ ./dsysbminer &
$ ./dsysbminer -http_port=8570 &
$ ./dsysbminer -http_port=8571 &
$ ./dsysbminer -http_port=8572 &
```


This starts four _dsysbminer_ instances on four different ports.

Then, when starting mining with _dsysbcmd_, you need to add the _http_ port number of _dsysbminer_ at the end, which is also 8569 by default, for example:

```bash
$ ./dsysbcmd start DUAv3s7ATF1s3ghkzPGDCTSFdgSTEfJw6g
$ ./dsysbcmd start DT4RqdQUPwkuJkhx7E145dvXUeAcwyKaN2 8570
$ ./dsysbcmd start DSxFbZR313JUkjAkx7fyHzciuQXuhaK2Sn 8571
$ ./dsysbcmd start DSrfva2rXhLtkzzhqbyEkn7TrKUL8DUGA9 8572
```

This will start four _dsysbminer_ mining instances. To stop, pause, and resume mining, simply add the port number at the end; the default is 8569.

Note! Do not allow multiple _dsysbminer_ under the same _dsysb_ to mine using the same wallet address, as this will cause duplicate calculations and waste computing power.

During mining calculations, the same _dsysb_ provides the same block data to all connected dsysbminers at the same time. If the block data and wallet addresses of these dsysbminers are the same, the data change resulting from the accumulation of _nonce_ will also be identical. Therefore, the command-line example above uses different wallet addresses.
