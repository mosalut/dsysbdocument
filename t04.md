# Transaction

The native transactions of __DSYSB__ are 7.

[coinbase](t05.md) Mining rewards; this transaction cannot be created manually.
[create](t06.md) Create an asset
[transfer](t07.md)
[exchange](t08.md)
[deploy](t09.md) Deployment tasks
[call](t0a.md) Call task
[extension](t0b.md) Increase the vitality of assets or tasks

Except for the _coinbase_, every transaction is created using the _createrawtransaction_ command, which is also shortened to _create_. Do not confuse this with the transaction type _create_.


The first parameter of _createrawtransaction_ is the transaction type, and the second parameter is _JSON_ data containing the actual content. The internal fields of the _JSON_ data are unordered, and the field names use camelCase naming convention.

Upon success, _createrawtransaction_ will return a set of codes, which is the binary sequence of the transaction.

_signrawtransaction_ will use this sequence to sign, generating a new sequence containing the signature. You can also use its abbreviation, _sign_.

The _sendrawtransaction_ command sends the transaction to the main program _dsysb_ for verification, using a sequence containing the signature as an argument. If successful, the transaction is added to the transaction pool and broadcast over the network. Other nodes receive the transaction and also verify it; if successful, they add it to their own transaction pools. This command can also be abbreviated as _send_.

_decoderawtransaction_ takes a raw-data(hex) string or a signed raw-data string as a parameter, and can convert the raw-data into transaction content for viewing at any time.

Of the commands above, except for _sendrawtransaction_, the others only display the returned results and do not make any changes to the program's memory data or the database, so you can use them with confidence.

Note! Each sendrawtransaction operation exposes the public key of the from address to the DSYSB network. For security, a public key that has exposed the from address should not be used. The more times it is exposed, the easier it is to crack the private key of that address. DSYSB is not a UTXO model and does not have a change-making mechanism, but it adds a hier field to inherit all assets from the from address. Specifying the hier address is equivalent to specifying a change-making address. If the hier address is not specified, then the hier address defaults to the from address itself.


In addition to _coinbase_, every transaction incurs a fee, which is calculated as follows:
In addition to the _coinbase_ field, each transaction's _JSON_ contains a _hier_ field. This field inherits all assets from the _from_ field, while deprecating the _from_ field containing public keys exposed in this transaction. If _hier_ is left blank, then _hier_ = _from_. This ensures that _from_ assets are not inherited by any other address and are not removed from the global state, effectively preventing deprecation.

```
Transaction fee = Number of bytes in the sequence × Price per byte
```

In _createrawtransaction_, the _nonce_ and _signer_ in the _JSON_ data are automatically generated and not entered by the user.
