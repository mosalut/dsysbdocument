# exchange

An _exchange_ is a transaction that consists of two transfer transactions.

The address _from_ which the first transfer must be the address _to_ which the second transfer is.

The address _to_ which the first transfer must be the address _from_ which the second transfer is located.

The _assetId_ of the two _transfer_ transactions cannot be the same. If the assetId is not filled in, it represents _DSB_, so only one of them can be left blank.

The following is a complete _exchange_ transaction command:

```bash
$ ./dsysbcmd create exchange '[{"assetId":"799c410ec35a61fe49ed209c457e3ba9d7bb40bcc9b0c6a304d2269c26a43592","from":"DMwoNvKQn7JRoovVqh7P9JvyvTwsVrrr3q","to":"DD7iFJRyd8GpKcLr3zuai96pzAPspuZxPa","amount":10000,"bytePrice":10},{"assetId":"121639f97c3b296b67edc208948e4d041bd4755f7a98274d6284d152be4af679","from":"DCUz2Z2D8C9YC7ZWaVBwAx16vygpAG4fST","to":"DMwoNvKQn7JRoovVqh7P9JvyvTwsVrrr3q","amount":50000,"bytePrice":10}]'
