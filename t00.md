# DSYSB Process Description
The entire DSYSB project consists of three programs:
- _dsysb_，the main program [dsysb ](dsysb.md)
- _dsysbminer_，the miner program [dsysbminer](dsysbminer.md)
- _dsysbcmd_，the command-line interaction program [dsysbcmd](dsysbcmd.md)


## dsysb
The main program is responsible for reading and writing blockchain data. On-chain data is written to an in-memory database via _dsysb_. Please do not start multiple _dsysb_ instances on a single system.

The main program is also responsible for interacting with other nodes, using the P2P network library implemented in the, [q2p](https://github.com/mosalut/q2p).

These interactions mainly involve block synchronization and verification.

## dsysbminer
The miner program is responsible for PoW mining. After mining a block, it sends it to the main program. The main program then verifies the new block. [Start Mining](t01.md)


## dsysbcmd
This is a command-line program that interacts with the main program and the miner program.

It is primarily used to view various information, including wallet address balances, the global state of the blockchain, query blocks, query transactions, etc.

It can also be used to view and generate wallet addresses.

It can also be used to start, stop, pause, and resume mining.

For detailed usage instructions for all commands, please see [dsysbcmd](dsysbcmd.md)


## removedatabase.sh
In Linux, a shell script was written to prevent accidental deletion to the wallet database and potential loss of the wallet's private key when clearing block data. When executing this script, adding the _network_id_ parameter specifies which network's block data to clear; this parameter defaults to 0.

```bash
./removedatabase.sh 16
```


# Preparation

## System Requirements:

- Operating System: Linux (64-bit), Windows 10 (insufficient testing).

# Installation and Configuration
- There are two ways to install and configure __DSYSB__:
1. Compile from source code
2. Download the package

## Compile from source code: using the Go programming language: [go language official documentation](https://go.dev/doc/install/source)

```bash
// Assume you already have the latest version of Go installed on your system
// And it's recommended to enable `go mod`
// Create any directory, here we'll use ~/work
$ mkdir ~/work
$ cd ~/work

// Create project directory
$ mkdir ~/dsysb


// Compile dsysb
$ git clone git@github.com:mosalut/dsysb.git // Pull the dsysb source code repository
$ cd dsysb // This dsysb directory was downloaded; it wasn't created just now, it just has the same name.
$ go build -o ~/dsysb/dsysb -ldflags "-w -s" . // A binary file named `dsysb` has now been compiled and placed in the ~/dsysb/ directory.

// Return to the ~/work directory
$ cd ~/work

// Compile dsysbminer
$ git clone git@github.com:mosalut/dsysbminer.git // Pull the dsysbminer source code repository
$ cd dsysb  
$ go build -o ~/dsysb/dsysbminer -ldflags "-w -s" .

// Compile dsysbcmd
$ git clone git@github.com:mosalut/dsysbcmd.git // Pull the dsysbcmd source code repository
$ cd dsysb  
$ go build -o ~/dsysb/dsysbcmd -ldflags "-w -s" .

$ cd ~/dsysb/
```

Now you are back in the _~/dsysb/_ directory, which contains the three executable files you created: dsysb, dsysbminer, and dsysbcmd.


## Download packages
If you don't know how to compile Go programs, you can download a pre-compiled package.

After downloading, the directory allocation can be the same as the "Compiling from Source Code" section above.

It is recommended to use packages released by the developers.

The programs released by the developers are guaranteed to be compiled from source code.

Downloading or accepting programs from other sources carries the risk of tampering.
