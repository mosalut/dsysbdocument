# create

When creating an asset, it calculates an assetId based on its own data. If the `assetId` already exists, then the asset will be created.

To prevent the accumulation of useless junk asset data on the blockchain, __DSYSB__ believes that if an asset is no longer maintained, it should become invalid and no longer be retained in subsequent blocks. To implement this invalidation mechanism, we assign a lifespan field to assets. The unit of lifespan is a block, and lifespan has a price. This price also serves as the threshold for transaction fees using this asset. In other words, the transaction fee _bytePrice_ for transactions using this asset must be greater than or equal to the asset's lifespan price.

The cost of the asset's lifespan is paid by the asset creator.

## Fields

- _name_: Asset name, 5-10 numbers or letters.
- _symbol_: Asset abbreviation, 3-5 numbers or letters.
- _decimals_: Decimal places.
- _totalSupply_: total supply.
- _price_: Unit price of asset life.
- _blocks_: How many blocks to survive.
- _from_: Creator's wallet address.
- _hier_: Heir's wallet address.
- _nonce_: Preventing replay attacks.
- _bytePrice_: Byte price.
- _signer_: Signature.

The following is a complete _create_ transaction command:

```bash
$ ./dsysbcmd create create '{"name":"aaaaaa","symbol":"AAA","decimals":8,"totalSupply":1000000000000000,"price":10,"blocks":10000,"from":"D892kxbavZUUmj5DHoVCJAFUWsWMeJCGQY","hier":"DT4RqdQUPwkuJkhx7E145dvXUeAcwyKaN2","bytePrice":1}'
```

Wait about two blocks, then you can use

```bash
$ ./dsysbcmd getassets
```

List all assets by _assetId_, so you'll see the _assetId_ of newly added assets.

Then use:

```bash
$ ./dsysbcmd getasset <assetId>
```

Review the specific asset details, locate your asset, and remember its asset ID for future transfers and other operations.

The asset has a _remain_ field, which indicates how many block the lifespan is left.
